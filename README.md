# PoE-CustomFilterSound-Manager

Helps you switching between Path of Exile custom loot filter sound packs. Save sound pack configurations and copy files to the PoE loot filter directory without manually renaming anything.

Works with all Neversink filters by default, you can use it for other filters by editing `fileNameList` to change the available files on the UI.

All first level subfolders of the folder "FilterSounds" will be recognized as their own filters if they contain any .mp3 file (does not work recursively/with subfolders). This folder will be created in the same directory if it doesn't exist.
